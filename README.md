Health Analytics Report: Key Findings on OCD Patients

Overview

This report summarizes the key demographic, temporal, and clinical findings derived from the provided health analytics dashboard concerning patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

1. Patient Volume Trend (2013 – 2022)

The total number of patients treated annually shows a notable fluctuation over the decade:

Initial Surge: The patient count started low in 2013 but saw a sharp increase leading into 2014.

Peak Period: The total number of patients reached its peak around 2018.

Recent Decline: Following the 2018 peak, the annual patient volume has shown a gradual, steady decline through 2022.

2. Demographic Distribution

Gender Ratio

The distribution between male and female patients is nearly equal, indicating that OCD affects both genders at very similar rates within this dataset.

Female Patients: 51.28%

Male Patients: 48.72%

Ethnicity Distribution

The patient population shows diversity, but specific ethnic groups exhibit higher counts:

Highest Prevalence: Caucasian and Hispanic patients represent the largest segments of the cohort, both reporting patient counts close to 400.

Lowest Prevalence: African patients show the lowest count among the measured groups, though still representing a significant portion of the total patient base (approximately 320).

3. Clinical Presentation Findings

Common Compulsions (Behaviors)

The five most common types of compulsions are widely distributed, with some behaviors slightly more prevalent than others:

Most Common: Counting and Washing are the most frequently reported compulsions, both nearing the maximum count shown on the chart.

Highly Prevalent: Checking, Praying, and Ordering follow closely, all registering high counts. This suggests that treatment programs should broadly address the full range of common ritualistic behaviors.

Obsession Counts (Thoughts)

Obsessive themes are also highly common, with two types clearly leading the presentation:

Leading Obsessions: Harm-related and Contamination obsessions are the most common intrusive thought patterns reported by patients.

Other Obsessions: Religious, Symmetry, and Hoarding are also highly prevalent, clustering slightly lower than the top two but still affecting a large number of patients.

Conclusion

The analytics suggest a slight female majority in the OCD population, with Caucasian and Hispanic patients forming the largest ethnic groups. Clinically, the data highlights a high co-occurrence and prevalence across almost all major compulsion and obsession types, though Counting/Washing (compulsions) and Harm-related/Contamination (obsessions) stand out as primary focus areas. The patient load peaked in 2018 and has been decreasing since, which warrants further investigation into operational changes or external factors influencing patient intake.
